                <p> In what can only be described as a cinematic mind-fuck of rhythmic clarity, Kendrick Lamar’s politically-charged lyrics highlight both the internal & external ills, trials and tribulations of an everyday working-class African-American, illustrating a true depiction of his society, one vivid masterpiece at a time. Over the past decade, he has owned his craft, studying those who have come before him and drawing upon these influences to create music soaked in the origins of hip-hop in every sense of the word — enlightenment, representation and education. </p>
